        buried in the crypts of Westminster Abbey in London:

        "When I was young and free and my imagination had no limits, I dreamed
        of changing the world. As I grew older and wiser, I discovered the world
        would not change, so I shortened my sights somewhat and decided to
        change only my country. "But it too, seemed immovable. "As I grew into
        my twilight years, in one last desperate attempt, I settled for changing
        only my family, those closest to me, but alas, they would have none of
        it. "And now as I lie on my deathbed, I suddenly realise, If I had only
        changed myself first, then by example I would have changed my family.
        From their inspiration and encouragement, I would then have been able to
        better my country and, who knows, I may have even changed the world."
        "Just don't give up on trying to do what you really want to do. Where
        there is love and inspiration, I don't think you can go wrong."

        New York is 3 hours ahead of California, but it does not make California
        slow. Someone graduated at the age of 22, but waited 5 years before
        securing a good job! Someone became a CEO at 25, and died at 50. While
        another became a CEO at 50,and lived to 90 years. Someone is still
        single, while someone else got married. Obama retires at 55, but Trump
        starts at 70. Absolutely everyone in this world works based on their
        Time Zone. People around you might seem to go ahead of you, some might
        seem to be behind you. But everyone is running their own RACE, in their
        own TIME. Don’t envy them or mock them. They are in their TIME ZONE, and
        you are in yours! Life is about waiting for the right moment to act. So,
        RELAX. You’re not LATE. You’re not EARLY. You are very much ON TIME, and
        in your TIME ZONE.
